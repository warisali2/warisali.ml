# Background
I was interested in programming since I was in 6th grade. But because of no proper guidance, I messed around here and 
there in the technologies realm. I liked making computer do things. Whenever I got an idea, I just search about it on the
internet and made it. But after some time, I started to feel like I was not becoming master in some field. I was like jack
of all trades but the master of none. 

So I started reading a lot of articles on How to choose a field in Computer Science. I wanted a field that allowed me to create new interesting things but still had a 
scientific touch to it. So, I finally choose to pursue mastery in Machine Learning field 
because in this field I don't only have to learn different kinds tools, there's maths and science too.

So I am writing this article to help those who are don't know what field to pursue their careers in, or just starting out
in Computer Science in general.

# Introduction
Information has changed the world. More industries than ever are leveraging IT to solve problems. As companies strive to 
keep up with the times, more job are becoming available. But with so many options to choose from, how do you decide 
which one to choose from?

As the old saying goes, knowledge is power, and I hope this article will empower you to make an informed decision in your 
pursuit of IT developer careers. 

This is a long post but try to read fully, It will help you a lot.

# Core IT Skills
Each career path in IT requires significantly different preparation. However, they all share a common core of knowledge and 
skills.
  
## Technical Skills
One of the most important aspects of being an IT developer is an ability to program machines. Here, the term developer 
implies an ability to build. In the case of IT developers, what you are building is IT systems consisting of hardware 
controlled by software produced through programming. However, programming skills by themselves are not very useful 
unless they are coupled with specific domains such as cyber security or system administration.

## Soft Skills
Technical skills may lead you to job interviews or even job offers. But they are not the only thing that interviewer is
seeing during the interview. He is also focusing on your soft skills that is oral presentation skills, writing skills, 
interpersonal skills, time management skills, leadership skills et cetera.

Due to service nature of IT field, you don't spend all of your time sitting in a cubicle, typing code all day. Even in
smaller companies, a lot of your time will be spent meeting with customers or coworkers, because you are developing 
solutions for them. So you need to interact with them to better understand their problems.

So, Don't ever think you only need technical skills to succeed in IT career. you definitely need social skills as well.

# Major Fields
There are numerous flavors of IT developer jobs out there and it's impossible to cover all of them because new ones are 
still coming out even as we speak. The best approach is to focus on the major categories and career path. 

## Software Engineering
A big portion of IT developers are Software Developers whose primary responsibilities revolve around producing software.
This field is called Software Engineering, whose main focus is develop software. Software Engineering can be further
sub divided into sub fields based the certain aspects of Software Engineering they specialize in, which are:

- Requirement Analyst
- System Architect
- Software Developer or Programmer
- Quality Assurance Specialist and Tester
- Deployment Specialist or DevOps Specialist

These reflect tasks that need to be completed at various steps of software development. For example, requirements 
analysis sets off a software development project because you need to understand what users want before even thinking 
about writing a single line of code. Software architecture is another important aspect and provides a structure germane 
to desired overall behaviors of software, such as performance and security.

Under the guidance of a software architect, software developers design their software solutions and implement them in 
code. Testing and QA insure that the implemented code conforms to the requirements, both functional and non-functional. 
Finally, the software is ready to be installed in a production environment and "deployment" refers to this process. 

### Careers in Software Engineering

#### Requirement Analyst
We develop software to solve our problems. But problems are continuously or our needs are continuously changing. So, even
for a well known problem like hotel reservations, new systems are being developed daily. because our needs are changing.

When Hotel Reservations started in 1900s, there was no such thing as credit card and now we can rent extra rooms in our 
homes using services like airbnb.com

Due to this dynamic nature of what users want and their technology choices, understanding their needs is extremely 
important. Almost 50% of software projects fail or face cost overruns because they are solving the wrong problems, or 
a lot of problems at the same time.

So task of requirement analysis and elicitation is as important as writing the lines of code to develop the software.

This is why we need experts in eliciting software requirements and keeping track of them due to their ever changing 
property. We call these specialists Software Requirements Analysts. Remember that defining a problem and its scope is 
as important as designing a solution and implementing it. As a result, the importance of the role of Requirements 
Analyst can never be overstated. 

#### Software Architect
The role of Software Architect is considered the pinnacle of software engineering. Software Architect is a person who has 
spent a lot of time in every aspect of Software Engineering.

He acts as Technical leader in team who works along side Project manager to provide necessary resources and making sure 
software is delivered on time. Common responsibilities of Software Architecture 
includes designing the architecture of the software, defining design visions, reviewing code and authorizing its 
inclusion in the working software.

#### Software Developer or Programmer
The role of a computer programmer is to interpret the design document put together by a software architect or 
a team lead into functioning code. The process of turning design into code is called implementation. Being a 
programmer means that you are a member of a large group of software engineers who are requirements analysts, 
software architects, QA engineers, testers, and deployment specialists.

This means that you need to be a collaborative team player. In a typical enterprise software development project today, 
it's no longer feasible to be a jack of all trades. You're bound to depend on other members of your software 
engineering team whose roles are complementary to your job as a programmer. Another important aspect of your position 
as a software engineer, is ability to use tools such as integrated development environments, or IDE, and design 
languages like unified modeling language, or UML, not to mention knowing multiple programming languages.

Knowledge in software development methodologies is also critical because more and more organizations are adopting them. 
Some of you may have already heard of scrum or the agile methodology, which is two of the most popular software 
development methodologies used today. So being a programmer means constant learning. New tools and methodologies, 
as well as programming languages are coming out all the time and you really have to be an independent learner 
to stay on top of your profession as a programmer these days. 

#### Quality Assurance Specialist and Tester
Software quality is different from functionality. Your software may be perfectly functional, but its quality could still 
be poor. It may perform all of the functions but it may not be responsive, reliable, or intuitive enough.

More recently, privacy and security concerns are making the users worried about identity theft or malicious software or 
malware infection. This overall user experience, with respect to the quality attributes of software, such as 
performance, usability, reliability, and security, is what quality assurance, or QA, professionals address. They can 
act as the expected users of software and provide timely feedback to remove any major quality glitches before the 
actual customers start complaining.

QA specialists can closely work with the rest of the software engineering team to improve the quality of software 
throughout a software development process.

Testing is much narrower in scope. As a test engineer, your role is to attempt to break the software you're testing. 
The goal here is to find as many bugs as possible so that the software doesn't misbehave when it's released and being 
used by the general public. Testers usually work closely with requirements analysts because they test their software 
against the software requirements produced earlier during the software development process.

Although different in their scope, both QA specialists and testers strive to increase the overall quality of software 
by scrutinizing it in their own ways.

#### Deployment Specialist and DevOps Specialist
Releasing the first version of software is a big milestone in the software development process. But, that's just the 
beginning. We know that the first release is only the start of many more future ones to come due to changes in user 
requirements, bug fixes, library updates, upgrades, et cetera. This repeated and iterative nature of software releases   
requires expertise and gracefully deploying software into it's desired environment to avoid any potential hiccups and 
to ensure smooth transition from testing to production.

Depending on how smoothly the deployment process goes, the success or failure of your business is at stake. Because of 
this elevated importance of seamless software development, industry leaders are attempting to automate the deployment 
process in general. DevOps is an example towards this trend.

One of the goals of DevOps is to free deployment specialist from the mundane tasks of manually setting up environments 
and allocating sources through automation and constant monitoring. Although DevOps is a much more comprehensive concept 
than software release and deployment, it definitely has an impact on the job of deployment specialist which is now more 
about helping with the automation and monitoring of the deployment process.  

### Preparation Tips
To become a software engineer, the most conventional route to take is going through a formal education process, that 
being a college degree. Most colleges have computer science degree programs and even software engineering majors. 
At four-year institutions an engineering college often houses computer science or computer engineering degree programs. 
As its name suggests Computer Engineering focuses more on hardware while computer science 
programs are more about developing software.

Of course you don't necessarily have to earn a computer science or software engineering degree to become a software 
engineer, many are self-taught. Regardless of your background it's not too difficult to pursue a career as a 
software engineer.

There are a few reasons for this. First there's a huge demand for software engineers out there. Second companies mostly 
care about your skills and what you're capable of doing rather than what degrees you have. As long as you're technically 
qualified with decent soft skills, you should be able to get your job. Finally unlike like other professions, 
there are so many online resources and communities that can support your pursuit of software engineering career.

All you have to do is making the efforts, which could be the biggest challenge. 

### Certifications
There are numerous available certifications in software engineering. Some of them are vendor-specific and others are 
not. 

The IEEE Computer Society's offering three vendor-neutral certifications which are 

- Associate Software Developer 
- Professional Software Developer 
- Professional Software Engineering Master Certification


Vendor-specific exams appeared to be doing much better. There are dozens of well respected exams that are driving and 
popular among software engineers. These include 

- Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer or MCSD, 
- Amazon Web Services Certified Developer
- Oracle Certified Java Professional or OCP
- Many others

As you can see there are so many certification opportunities in software engineering. You need to pick and choose the 
best ones for your own needs. Your job may require you to get certified and even pay for the certification exams. Your 
career plans should also guide you in the choice of certifications to pursue. If you're thinking about transitioning 
into a new career path certifications can be a good stepping stone to build your credentials. 

You may not need certifications to get a job, but it's good to showcase your skills and credentials. Having one increases
you chances of getting a good job by a lot.

## System Administration
System administration involves installing operating systems, configuring them, and maintaining a network of computers 
powered by those OS's. System administrators ensure that the computer systems they manage are reliable and available 
enough to meet the requirements of their organization and end users. The efforts made by system administrators should 
be cost effective and satisfy their budget constraints.

Additionally system administrator concerns include performance, resource consumption, and security. System 
administration has it's own sub-fields such as operating system, platform, and discipline specific areas. Regardless 
of their specialization, system administrators should have a good understanding of computer networking concepts 
because connecting computer systems lays a foundation for their work.

Due to the enormous amount of knowledge required for each subfield, system administrators tend to specialize in a 
specific technology. In terms of operating systems, they focus on either Windows or Unix/Linux. New platforms such as 
cloud computing requires a different set of skills from those necessary for Windows or Unix/Linux system administrators. 
Discipline or domain specific aspect of system administration also ask for additional training and specialization.

Big data is an emerging technology field which calls for an upgrade in system administrator expertise because it 
demands familiarity with so many new tools and technologies. Of course you can learn it all and do it all too, but the 
chance of doing that continues to decrease as the field of system administration expands and in its scope and depth.

### Careers in System Administration

#### Unix/Linux
Unix has a long history. It originates from the Multics operating system or "OS", jointly developed by MIT, 
AT&T Bell Labs, and GE in the 1960's. Unix was intended for mainframe systems. Essentially, a big computer designed 
to serve many remote users. Linux was a Unix-like operating system developed for personal computers, or "PC's" in 
1990's.

Linux is open source and free software, while Unix is proprietary. Because of this longevity, the Unix-Linux OS are 
loaded with features and offers lots of nooks and crannies to explore for beginners. Although, Unix-Linux distributions 
provide graphical user interfaces or "GUI", a majority of system administration tasks still rely on command line 
interfaces. The command line based operation is what makes the Unix-Linux OS powerful. Especially, for tasks to 
be conducted by system administrators. Automation is relatively easy, because all you need is a text file called 
"Shell Script" consisting of a few lines of commands.

However, because of the steep learning curve associated with Unix-Linux, Windows OS are more appealing to many systems 
administrator candidates out there. But please note that, many server programs widely in use today are Unix-Linux based. 
Apache Web server and Secure Shell server are classic examples. Therefore, learning the Unix-Linux OS may be worth the 
trouble. Unix-Linux also has ample networking support and tools, which sweeten the deal! If you're more interested in 
managing servers rather than end-user machines, Unix-Linux is definitely you're ticket to a dream job! The underlying 
automation capabilities Unix-Linux offers will definitely make you look good with a less amount of work when the duty 
calls, as long as you are willing to digest and eventually master the vast sea of information on Unix and Linux.

#### Windows
Windows operating systems have the biggest market share, especially on desktop computers. According to statista.com in 
its latest data analysis, more than 80% of desktop computers, worldwide, used Windows OS. This dominant position Windows 
OS has provided strong job security for Windows system administrators.

Organizations use Windows Server OS to manage desktop computers. One of your tasks, as a Windows system administrator, 
is to limit access to a particular system resource on individual computers. Let's assume that you want to disable USB 
port access on computers to enhance security. When there is a small number of computers, you can do this manually on 
each computer, one by one, but this process is not scalable.

Using the powerful access control feature of Windows Server OS, you can accomplish this task in seconds instead of 
hours. This is just one example of many of the advantages of using Windows Server OS for your system administration 
tasks. Of course, the scenario only works well when your computers run only Windows OS, which is why you are inclined 
to build an ecosystem of a Windows product line as a Windows system administrator.

To compensate for the lack of powerful and native scripting tools, Windows OS has also introduced a tool, like 
PowerShell, and are making attempts to catch up with the efficient and graceful characteristics of its Unix-Linux 
counterparts. For the foreseeable future, Windows OS seems to keep its dominant position in the marketplace, and 
this is an excellent reason you should consider being a Windows system administrator.

#### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is no longer an emerging technology. We are now surrounded by products built on Cloud computing 
technology. We use Cloud storage services like One Drive and DropBox on a daily basis. We create documents using Google 
Docs. We store our photos in the Amazon Cloud. While the end users like us reap the benefits of Cloud computing, 
there need to be system administrators behind the scenes working on the infrastructure that makes Cloud computing 
possible.

One of the core technologies Cloud computing administrators must master is Hypervisor, which is a special operating 
system or OS, specifically designed to run virtual machines or VM on itself. Virtual machines are logical containers 
on which full blown OS can be installed and become operational. A hypervisor allows you to create multiple VMs on a 
single physical computer, which in turn can run their own independent OS.

The end result is that you can provision any flavor of OS such as Windows or Linux on demand. You can also connect 
multiple physical machines to create an illusion of a single logical machine that can fire up hundreds and thousands 
of VMs as long as you have enough memory and CPUs on the computers constituting the Cloud Infrastructure. Based on 
the description so far, you can get a glimpse of why Cloud computing is so scalable and how complex the enabling 
technologies can be.

#### Big Data
Big data is a term that describes a large dataset. The concept of big data is always changing because big data today may not be 
treated as big data tomorrow. Why? Because the storage and processing capacities of a single computer will grow rapidly 
due to technological advances.

New tools are necessary to store and process big data and they're all based on the idea of distributed systems. The 
concept of distributed systems is nothing new but we can now implement distributed systems much more effectively. One 
important aspect of distributed systems is distributed file systems which allows commodity computers to share their 
file systems across a network.

Another facet is distributed processing which divides a big job into many small pieces that can be run on individual 
computers without special hardware. There are big data tools available for creating a distributed file system such as 
Hadoop. MapReduce and Spark are softer solutions for distributed processing. There are many more specialty distributed 
processing software applications and the number is growing.

As a big data system administrator you need to be proficient with these big data tools of the trade and help data 
scientists solve various analytics problems. Since big data is relatively new, there aren't enough professionals 
trained to manage big data infrastructures, which is a golden opportunity for those of you who are brave and 
interested in becoming a big data system administrator.   

### Preparation Tips
Like other IT developers careers, system administrator candidates can go through either formal programs or 
unconventional routes. The field of system administration is relatively well established and both two-year and 
four-year colleges offer majors concentrating on it. Regardless of the type of training your receive, one of the 
most important things to remember is your exposure to the technologies you'll be tackling professionally.

To reach the level of proficiency you'd like to have as a system administrator, you really have to fall in love with 
the technologies of your choice. If you choose to become a Unix/Linux system administrator, the operating system 
commands should be almost your second nature. The experience is like that of learning a language. If you don't use 
it, you lose it. You have to be willing to spend a significant amount of time to eventually master the operating 
systems.

The same applies to all the other OS and tools system administrators have to deal with. The sooner you start learning 
these technologies, the better, which is why you have to make some strategic decisions early on regarding which 
technologies to focus on. As in any other IT developer professions, you also need to constantly upgrade and update 
your skills.

If you don't pay attention to these new developments, your abilities can quickly become obsolete. As usual, the most 
important ingredient in being successful in a system of the administrative profession is your passion, otherwise, 
nothing else matters. 

### Certifications
The System Administrator Certifications vary depending on what technologies are involved. Redhat offers a number of 
options for Unix/Linux system administrators. Some of their certifications include 

- Redhat System Administration 
- Certified System Administrator

CompTIA is another organization providing certification opportunities. __CompTIA Linux+__ is one of their certifications. 

There are also other vendors, such as Oracle and Linux Professional Institute, or LPI. Microsoft has its own 
certification program for its Windows product line and **Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator**, or MCSA, 
is available for system administrators. 

Cloud computing has been around for awhile and there are many options for certifications. One of the major cloud 
computing vendors is VMware, and its certifications are **VMware Certified Associate, or VCA, 
and Professional, or VCP,** series. Microsoft also has its own cloud computing platform called Azure, and its 
certification is **Microsoft Azure Certification Exam.** 

Big Data certifications revolve around specific products. These include 

- Amazon Web Services or AWS
- Certified Big Data Specialty
- Cloudera Certified Professional Data Engineer or CCPDE
- Cloudera Certified Associate or CCA
- Spark and Hadoop Developer
- SAS Big Data Certification

There are many more certifications available for system administrators, and, as usual, you must be 
wise about which certifications to get because they are expensive and time-consuming to obtain and maintain. 

## Cyber Security
The internet has brought us unprecedented opportunities, including e-commerce, user-generated content such as Youtube, 
and online education, just to name a few. Despite these positive outcomes, we're also suffering from the consequences 
of criminal activities occurring in cyberspace. Cybersecurity is a term referring to both preventive and reactive 
countermeasures designed to remove or reduce the widespread threats in cyberspace, or in other words, the internet.

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important. New threats are appearing constantly. Many of them end up affecting 
our daily lives. Organizations are aware of this reality and seeking help. To respond to this need, a new breed of 
I.T. developers has emerged.

We call them cybersecurity professionals. Cybersecurity threats come in many shapes and forms, and so do the career 
paths in cybersecurity. Penetration testers launch simulated cybersecurity attacks against organizations, to check 
their readiness. Computer forensics specialists investigate security incidents and produce evidence for legal or 
other disciplinary actions.

I.T. auditors are responsible for the accounting of an organization's compliance to the rules and regulations of 
its own or those imposed by government and industry regulators. Network security professionals are I.T. warriors 
at the forefront of cybersecurity warfare. They monitor our networks to detect any anomalies and respond to attacks. 
These are the first responders in cybersecurity.

The field of cybersecurity is still evolving, and there are many more relatively-new job titles already 
out there or will be coming out soon. The career paths listed here are some of the most representative ones 
available today. 

### Careers in Cyber Security

#### Penetration Tester
Penetration testers conduct simulated attacks against organizations to test their cyber-security readiness. They get 
permissions ahead of taking any actions to avoid any unintended results. Many details, including the rules of 
engagement, need to be negotiated before the testing process begins and penetration or pen testing companies usually 
produce a proposal to be signed by all the stakeholders to get their permissions to go ahead.

One of the most common items to be tested is social engineering readiness. Humans are often the weakest link in 
cyber-security, and social engineering takes advantage of vulnerabilities found in people to break in. A spear phishing 
attack is an example. Attackers send an email to a targeted victim to mislead the person to eventually reveal sensitive 
information or take an action that can compromise the security of an organization.

Penetration testers frequently send spear phishing emails to see how employees respond to them. Another popular test is 
to bypass defense mechanisms like firewalls and leave a piece of evidence of a successful attack as a proof of the type 
of a possible attack. This could be as simple as a text file in a file system. Pen testers document all their activities 
in a comprehensive report demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the security stance of an organization.

What's critical in what they do is that no real harm should exist at any point of their testing and penetration testing 
should never pose any true threats against the normal business operations of their customers. After all, the goal is to 
avoid attacks and not become part of the statistics.

#### Computer Forensics
Computer forensics is a field in which IT developers investigate criminal activities in cyberspace, and produce 
evidence for legal and regulatory actions. Criminal justice, or CJ, is closely related to computer forensics because 
people in CJ are one of the consumers of the evidence prepared by computer forensics professionals. These CJ workers 
include law enforcement officers, and they played a crucial role in the development of computer forensics, especially 
in it's early stage.

Early on, they noticed that computers were being used to commit crimes, and they had to quickly acquire necessary 
computer skills to conduct their criminal investigations and eventually to produce evidence to be submitted to court. 
This is why we still see heavy law enforcement involvement in the computer forensics industry. We've come a long way 
since this humble beginning of computer forensics. These days, many colleges offer computer forensics courses in their 
cybersecurity curriculum, or majors specializing in computer forensics.

If you happen to have a background in law enforcement and are interested in pursuing an IT developer career, I strongly 
recommend that you try computer forensics. You'll find your criminal justice knowledge handy in many aspects of 
conducting your computer forensics investigations and generating reports. For those of you who have little knowledge in 
CJ, don't worry. The amount of CJ concepts you have to learn to do your job as a computer forensics specialist is 
manageable.

And you certainly don't need a CJ degree to be effective in your tasks at hand.  

#### IT Auditing
IT auditing helps organizations account for their compliance to both internal and external rules and regulations 
associated with information technology. A significant portion of IT auditing is devoted to cybersecurity, due to its 
increasing importance. There are industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or 
PCI DSS, that requires companies to go through an annual security audit process.

The rigor and scope depend on the size of the company, and any organizations accepting credit cards as part of their 
financial transactions are obligated to comply with PCI DSS. If they're not compliant, they will face a steep fine. 
In terms of government regulations, one of the most famous is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or 
HIPAA. HIPAA requires organizations to implement safeguards, especially in the area of privacy.

Health care providers and companies dealing with sensitive patient health care information or PHI have to be able to 
demonstrate how their IT personnel are protecting their PHI against potential cybersecurity threats. Both PCI DSS and 
HIPAA are creating enormous opportunities for IT auditing professionals because organizations have immediate needs to 
regularly check if they are compliant, and this is what IT auditors are expected to do.

There are also other cybersecurity-related rules and regulations organizations should look out for, which is generating 
even more IT auditing tasks. If you have an accounting background as well as cybersecurity, you are very well suited to 
jump into IT auditing because of your aptitude toward compliance and knowledge in computer security. For those of you 
who have no prior background, I encourage you to check out both accounting and cybersecurity topics, because both are 
needed to develop your skills as an effective IT auditor.

#### Network Security
Network Security Professionals are responsible for monitoring suspicious activities in a computer network and taking 
necessary actions to prevent or stop security attacks against a local area network or wide area network they are in 
charge of. Networking and telecommunications are an essential component of our modern computer infrastructure. Without 
them, the internet would not have been made possible.

Unfortunately, network connectivity also enables cyber criminals to get unauthorized access to our computers. There are 
many known and unknown vulnerabilities in our networking hardware and software which range from operating system 
glitches to outdated firmware found in switches and routers. Network engineers are a natural fit for becoming network 
security professionals because of their expertise in computer networking.

However, this transition doesn't occur automatically unless a candidate makes the necessary investment in studying 
cybersecurity. There are many aspects of network security which demand years of education and training. These include 
topics such as firewalls, virtual private networks or VPN, cryptography, intrusion detection and prevention systems, 
logging and network management. Data science is also important in network security because there is so much network 
security data generated from numerous sources throughout a network.

Network security professionals should be able to analyze this data in order to make informed decisions on protecting 
their networks. If you like toys and have an inquisitive mind, network security is a great career path to pursue.  

### Preparation Tips
After getting more informed about all the opportunities in cybersecurity, you may now be eager to find out how to join 
the workforce. Cybersecurity is one of those disciplines that demands systematic training and education for those who 
want to successfully pursue careers in them. You definitely need guidance in the form of a well-developed curriculum. 
It's also tremendously helpful if you have access to practitioners who can give you insights that can only be obtained 
in the trenches.

Because of the diversity of career path you can seek in cybersecurity, it's important to decide on which specialization 
to go after as soon as possible. An ideal approach would be for you to develop decent foundational knowledge in 
cybersecurity first, before you make your own career path decisions. What you learn from textbooks and in classrooms 
may be quite different from what you could be experiencing as a cybersecurity expert working on a particular problem.

This is why it's important to have mentors and internship opportunities as part of your preparation for becoming a 
cybersecurity professional. You will get a much better feel for a certain career path once you spend some quality time 
actually tackling real-life problems and mingling with industry professionals. Once you know what you want to do, the 
next step is to drill down into the specific software tools or concepts.

If your job is computer forensics specialist, it's essential to learn how to use software packages, such as Forensics 
Toolkit, also known as FTK or EnCase. If you're in the profession of IT auditing, developing a deep understanding of 
PCI DSS or HIPAA is a must. The nice thing about the cybersecurity profession is that it has so many facets, and almost 
anybody with varying interests and capabilities can find their own calling and ways to be driving in what they do.

### Certifications
One of the most widely recognized cybersecurity certifications is **Certified Information Systems Security Professional 
or CISSP**. International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or ISC squared, is the organization 
issuing CISSP certification. It also offers more specialized certifications such as, **Certified Secure Software 
Lifecycle Professional, or CSSLP and, Certified Cloud Security Professional or CCSP.** 

If you're looking for an entry-level cybersecurity certification **Security Plus offered by CompTIA** is a great choice. 

Penetration testers can earn the **Certified Ethical Hacker or CEH certification,** made available by the 
International Counsel of Electronic Commerce Consultants, or EC-Council. EC-Council provides more advanced options 
for pen testers such as **EC-Council Certified Security Analyst, or ECSA, and Licensed Penetration Tester, or LPT.** 

**IT auditors** can get the **Certified Information Systems Auditor, or CISA** certification through 
Information Systems Audit and Control Association, or ISACA.

Some of the well known **computer forensic certifications** are 

- Global Information Assurance Certification Forensic Examiner or GCFE
- Global Information Assurance Certification Forensic Analyst or GCFA
- Certified Cyber Forensic Professional by ISC squared
- Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator or CHFI by EC-Council.

There are also vendor-specific computer forensic certifications like 

- Access Data Certified Examiner or ACE
- EnCase Certified Examiner or ENCE

For **network security professionals** Cisco offers

- Cisco Certified Network Associates Security
- Cisco Certified Network Professional Security Certifications 

## Data Science
Data science is booming, and there's a good reason for it. We live in a data rich world and there is a growing need to 
turn all this data into information, so that we can constantly improve what we're doing. Education is one of the sectors 
that can immensely benefit from data science. We have plenty of data about our students in the form of exam scores, 
their online activities in learning management systems, or LMS, social media, submitted homework assignments et cetera.

If we had adequate resources to help with analyzing the student data in our possession I'm pretty sure that we could 
quickly do some innovative things in improving the lives of our students and enhancing the chance of their academic 
success. However, the reality is that we are not able to keep up with the demand for data science professionals and a 
lot of our visionary projects are put on hold.

This is why we need more professionals in data science. In IT, developers can make a difference by automating various 
aspects of data science, especially those labor intensive and mundane ones. Among the options available today, machine 
learning seems to be one of the most promising technologies, and this trend presents a relatively new data science 
career path in machine learning. Since there are so many software tools that work as enablers in data science, it's now 
mandatory for data scientists to almost double as IT developers.

A bare minimum requirement is ability to be able to program in popular data science computer languages such as Python or
 R. If your job deals with big data, you need to be familiar with technologies such as Hadoop, MapReduce and Spark. 
 Data scientists also play the role of an interpreter between highly technical domain experts and lay people who consume 
 the results of a data analysis effort.

To be effective in your interpreter role, you need to be able to use powerful visual aids, which is why there is a data 
science specialty focusing on visualization. Data science is getting a lot of traction these days and you will have 
ample opportunity to develop your career in this newly emerging and evolving field.

### Careers in Data Science

#### Data Scientist
The data scientist's job title is quite broad by design. These days organizations of all sizes need help with turning 
their data into actionable intelligence. Bigger companies can afford to hire multiple employees to work on their data 
science projects, each focusing on different aspects such as data cleaning and analysis, machine learning, and 
visualization. Smaller companies are lucky to have a dedicated data scientist position.
 
The data scientist job titles comes handy for these smaller scale operations that are only able to hire generalists 
rather than multiple specialists. Therefore, although lacking depth, a data scientist should be able to deal with 
almost any aspect of data science tasks mentioned earlier. Let's say that your boss wants to know how the salaries 
of his employees compare to those of people working at other departments in comparable positions.
 
You initially need to wear a data science analyst hat to locate the data you want and prepare it for further analysis. 
Luckily, there are a number of inexpensive commodity data science services available in the cloud today. These include 
Amazon Quickstart, IBM Data Science Experience and Microsoft Azure Data Science Virtual Machine.
 
Armed with these affordable tools at your fingertips, you can proceed with your data analysis. In this scenario, 
you may not need heavy-duty, big data services at all but can still benefit from reporting and visualization functions 
available in the cloud. The data science position described in this scenario is an excellent opportunity to show off 
your IT developer skills. Because it challenges you in many areas of your training in IT development, like programming 
skills, knowledge in software tools, and on-the-job domain knowledge training.
 
If you are a recent graduate of a four year applied data science program, you are perfectly suited for this jack of all 
trades position. If you have a background in IT or computer science, you also have a great potential to be successful 
in an entry-level data scientist position. You just have to be willing to do a lot of self-study in data analysis and 
data science tools to build on your IT foundation.

#### Data Analyst
If you despise the idea of being a generalist, you have ample opportunities to become a specialist in Data Science. 
One such option is becoming a Data Analyst. As its name suggests, this job focuses on preparing, processing, and 
analyzing data. To excel in this position, you need to be well-versed in statistics, scripting languages like Python, 
and data analysis packages such as, Excel, SPSS, SAS, and R.

If you're dealing with big data and need to do some heavy lifting in distributed data processing, you should at least 
know how to prepare your data analysis jobs to be worked on popular distributed processing platforms such as MapReduce 
and Spark. The nice thing about being a data analyst is that you can just concentrate on what you do best. That is, 
data analysis, and don't worry about other things that must happen in a typical Data Science workflow.

These include all the IT Plumbing work of database management, installing and maintaining statistics packages, cloud 
computing, and distributed processing platforms, etc. If you're ambitious and would like to expand your territory into 
predictive data analysis using Big Data Analytics, you're well-positioned to develop your career into a Data Machine 
Learning Specialist.

This transition may not be so difficult because there are already lots of great tools you can play with to learn the 
basics. I recommend that you start with Weka, which features powerful machine learning libraries with an intuitive 
graphical user interface or GUI. Have you made up your mind yet? Do you want to become a generalist or specialist? 
I'm sure you'll be fine no matter what you choose to do.   

#### Machine Learning
Machine learning scientist job is a step up from a data analyst position. This is further specialization of an 
already highly technical position. Because of this advanced nature of the position, it requires decades of 
training to become an experienced machine learning scientist. Basic machine learning tasks such as regression 
and clustering demand little manual intervention.

There are already well-known algorithms to get the job done, however not every problem can be solved in an optimal 
way using the existing consumer-grade machine learning solutions. Here, the key word is optimization. Take the problem 
of image recognition. We're already pretty good at it, but the solutions are not perfect and there is still room for 
improvement. This is why they still have competitions for custom image recognition.

In this example the challenge is to detect all ships in satellite images as quickly as possible. You cannot solve 
this type of machine learning problem by simply reusing the existing code. You must at least tweak it, or develop 
an entirely new model and its implementation to improve performance drastically. This is where your expertise as an 
IT developer shines. Surely, you do still have to have the right kind of highly special skills to pull this off.

General IT developer knowledge wouldn't cut it, but your training in computer science and IT will serve as a great 
foundation to build on. The ship identification test is left for the very best of IT developer mind. Therefore, if your 
job title is machine learning scientist, you are at the top of the IT developer food chain.

#### Visualization
A picture is worth a thousand words. When done properly, Visualization can be one of the most effective tools to 
convey the message your data is sending implicitly. Therefore, the role of a Visualization Specialist, is that of a 
Communicator or Translator. In this case, the communication, or translation, occurs through visual aids.

I'd like to remind you that, a majority of consumers of a data analysis, are laypeople, including managers, customers, 
decision makers, and so on. Your job as a Visualization Specialist, is to interpret the Numerical and often Cryptic 
data analysis results into an Intuitive graphic that truly conveys the most important information relevant to the data consumer needs.

Also necessary are Programming skills, and Knowledge in database management systems, because tools cannot always do 
everything for you. As you might already have guessed, other important qualities for Visualization Specialists are 
being artistic and creative. If what I have described so far is close to your aptitude and aspirations, don't 
hesitate to start your journey into this exciting Visualization Specialist career today.

We certainly need more people like you in the data science field.

### Preparation Tips
As the demand for data science increases, more and more colleges and universities are starting to offer 
undergraduate degree programs in data science. There are also a number of schools providing graduate programs in 
data science. There are pros and cons associated with starting early or later when it comes to your pursuit of a 
data science degree. Getting an early start as a college freshman means that you can develop your skills as a data 
scientist in a reasonable pace and in a balanced way, because you have four years to study various aspects of data 
science and get plenty of exposure to all the essential topics, tools, and technologies involved in data science.

This is a great option for those who aspire to be data scientists and data analysts. After getting a job in a particular 
field, such as business intelligence, or BI, you can develop your domain specific knowledge through your on the job 
training opportunities. This learning by doing approach is fine and can give you more options in terms of your job 
search because you can get a job in virtually any industries. Data science is a foundational topic like mathematics.

But Data Science is only meaningful when it's put into a 
context to solve problems in a specific domain. Therefore domain knowledge is critical for data science to keep its 
relevance. If you are a data scientist working in the cybersecurity industry, gaining expertise in networking or 
firewalls is highly beneficial because it gives you more insights when you're trying to do your job as a data scientist.

This is why it may be beneficial for you to get your undergraduate degree in a non-data science major like cybersecurity 
or business and then get your master's degree in data science. For those of you who are overachievers, a double major 
is also an option. If you are already a working professional in a particular industry, getting a master's degree in 
data science is a way to enhance your career opportunities.

As you can see, there is no right time to jump in to data science no matter where you are in your career development 
process.   

### Certifications
Data science is still evolving and so are it's certifications. 

Vendor neutral certifications are starting to appear, one of them is **Certfied Analytics Professional, or CAP**. 
The Analytics Certification Board oversees the CAP program and consists of members from both academia and industry. 
There are also a number of universities offering data science certificates.

Because of it's technology centered nature, data science industry has a number of vendor specific certifications. 
Companies like Microsoft, Cloudera, EMC, Oracle and SAS all have their own data science certification programs. 
Microsoft has it's **Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert, or MCSE, data management and analytics.** Cloudera offers it's 
**Cloudera Certified Professional, or CCP, data engineer certificate.**

Other certification opportunities include
