# Cyber Security
The internet has brought us unprecedented opportunities, including e-commerce, user-generated content such as Youtube, 
and online education, just to name a few. Despite these positive outcomes, we're also suffering from the consequences 
of criminal activities occurring in cyberspace. Cybersecurity is a term referring to both preventive and reactive 
countermeasures designed to remove or reduce the widespread threats in cyberspace, or in other words, the internet.

Cybersecurity is becoming increasingly important. New threats are appearing constantly. Many of them end up affecting 
our daily lives. Organizations are aware of this reality and seeking help. To respond to this need, a new breed of 
I.T. developers has emerged.

We call them cybersecurity professionals. Cybersecurity threats come in many shapes and forms, and so do the career 
paths in cybersecurity. Penetration testers launch simulated cybersecurity attacks against organizations, to check 
their readiness. Computer forensics specialists investigate security incidents and produce evidence for legal or 
other disciplinary actions.

I.T. auditors are responsible for the accounting of an organization's compliance to the rules and regulations of 
its own or those imposed by government and industry regulators. Network security professionals are I.T. warriors 
at the forefront of cybersecurity warfare. They monitor our networks to detect any anomalies and respond to attacks. 
These are the first responders in cybersecurity.

The field of cybersecurity is still evolving, and there are many more relatively-new job titles already 
out there or will be coming out soon. The career paths listed here are some of the most representative ones 
available today. 

## Careers in Cyber Security

### Penetration Tester
Penetration testers conduct simulated attacks against organizations to test their cyber-security readiness. They get 
permissions ahead of taking any actions to avoid any unintended results. Many details, including the rules of 
engagement, need to be negotiated before the testing process begins and penetration or pen testing companies usually 
produce a proposal to be signed by all the stakeholders to get their permissions to go ahead.

One of the most common items to be tested is social engineering readiness. Humans are often the weakest link in 
cyber-security, and social engineering takes advantage of vulnerabilities found in people to break in. A spear phishing 
attack is an example. Attackers send an email to a targeted victim to mislead the person to eventually reveal sensitive 
information or take an action that can compromise the security of an organization.

Penetration testers frequently send spear phishing emails to see how employees respond to them. Another popular test is 
to bypass defense mechanisms like firewalls and leave a piece of evidence of a successful attack as a proof of the type 
of a possible attack. This could be as simple as a text file in a file system. Pen testers document all their activities 
in a comprehensive report demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the security stance of an organization.

What's critical in what they do is that no real harm should exist at any point of their testing and penetration testing 
should never pose any true threats against the normal business operations of their customers. After all, the goal is to 
avoid attacks and not become part of the statistics.

### Computer Forensics
Computer forensics is a field in which IT developers investigate criminal activities in cyberspace, and produce 
evidence for legal and regulatory actions. Criminal justice, or CJ, is closely related to computer forensics because 
people in CJ are one of the consumers of the evidence prepared by computer forensics professionals. These CJ workers 
include law enforcement officers, and they played a crucial role in the development of computer forensics, especially 
in it's early stage.

Early on, they noticed that computers were being used to commit crimes, and they had to quickly acquire necessary 
computer skills to conduct their criminal investigations and eventually to produce evidence to be submitted to court. 
This is why we still see heavy law enforcement involvement in the computer forensics industry. We've come a long way 
since this humble beginning of computer forensics. These days, many colleges offer computer forensics courses in their 
cybersecurity curriculum, or majors specializing in computer forensics.

If you happen to have a background in law enforcement and are interested in pursuing an IT developer career, I strongly 
recommend that you try computer forensics. You'll find your criminal justice knowledge handy in many aspects of 
conducting your computer forensics investigations and generating reports. For those of you who have little knowledge in 
CJ, don't worry. The amount of CJ concepts you have to learn to do your job as a computer forensics specialist is 
manageable.

And you certainly don't need a CJ degree to be effective in your tasks at hand.  

### IT Auditing
IT auditing helps organizations account for their compliance to both internal and external rules and regulations 
associated with information technology. A significant portion of IT auditing is devoted to cybersecurity, due to its 
increasing importance. There are industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or 
PCI DSS, that requires companies to go through an annual security audit process.

The rigor and scope depend on the size of the company, and any organizations accepting credit cards as part of their 
financial transactions are obligated to comply with PCI DSS. If they're not compliant, they will face a steep fine. 
In terms of government regulations, one of the most famous is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or 
HIPAA. HIPAA requires organizations to implement safeguards, especially in the area of privacy.

Health care providers and companies dealing with sensitive patient health care information or PHI have to be able to 
demonstrate how their IT personnel are protecting their PHI against potential cybersecurity threats. Both PCI DSS and 
HIPAA are creating enormous opportunities for IT auditing professionals because organizations have immediate needs to 
regularly check if they are compliant, and this is what IT auditors are expected to do.

There are also other cybersecurity-related rules and regulations organizations should look out for, which is generating 
even more IT auditing tasks. If you have an accounting background as well as cybersecurity, you are very well suited to 
jump into IT auditing because of your aptitude toward compliance and knowledge in computer security. For those of you 
who have no prior background, I encourage you to check out both accounting and cybersecurity topics, because both are 
needed to develop your skills as an effective IT auditor.

### Network Security
Network Security Professionals are responsible for monitoring suspicious activities in a computer network and taking 
necessary actions to prevent or stop security attacks against a local area network or wide area network they are in 
charge of. Networking and telecommunications are an essential component of our modern computer infrastructure. Without 
them, the internet would not have been made possible.

Unfortunately, network connectivity also enables cyber criminals to get unauthorized access to our computers. There are 
many known and unknown vulnerabilities in our networking hardware and software which range from operating system 
glitches to outdated firmware found in switches and routers. Network engineers are a natural fit for becoming network 
security professionals because of their expertise in computer networking.

However, this transition doesn't occur automatically unless a candidate makes the necessary investment in studying 
cybersecurity. There are many aspects of network security which demand years of education and training. These include 
topics such as firewalls, virtual private networks or VPN, cryptography, intrusion detection and prevention systems, 
logging and network management. Data science is also important in network security because there is so much network 
security data generated from numerous sources throughout a network.

Network security professionals should be able to analyze this data in order to make informed decisions on protecting 
their networks. If you like toys and have an inquisitive mind, network security is a great career path to pursue.  

## Preparation Tips
After getting more informed about all the opportunities in cybersecurity, you may now be eager to find out how to join 
the workforce. Cybersecurity is one of those disciplines that demands systematic training and education for those who 
want to successfully pursue careers in them. You definitely need guidance in the form of a well-developed curriculum. 
It's also tremendously helpful if you have access to practitioners who can give you insights that can only be obtained 
in the trenches.

Because of the diversity of career path you can seek in cybersecurity, it's important to decide on which specialization 
to go after as soon as possible. An ideal approach would be for you to develop decent foundational knowledge in 
cybersecurity first, before you make your own career path decisions. What you learn from textbooks and in classrooms 
may be quite different from what you could be experiencing as a cybersecurity expert working on a particular problem.

This is why it's important to have mentors and internship opportunities as part of your preparation for becoming a 
cybersecurity professional. You will get a much better feel for a certain career path once you spend some quality time 
actually tackling real-life problems and mingling with industry professionals. Once you know what you want to do, the 
next step is to drill down into the specific software tools or concepts.

If your job is computer forensics specialist, it's essential to learn how to use software packages, such as Forensics 
Toolkit, also known as FTK or EnCase. If you're in the profession of IT auditing, developing a deep understanding of 
PCI DSS or HIPAA is a must. The nice thing about the cybersecurity profession is that it has so many facets, and almost 
anybody with varying interests and capabilities can find their own calling and ways to be driving in what they do.
