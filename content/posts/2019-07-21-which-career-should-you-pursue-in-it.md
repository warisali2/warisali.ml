# Background
I was interested in programming since I was in 6th grade. But because of no proper guidance, I messed around here and 
there in the technologies realm. I liked making computer do things. Whenever I got an idea, I just search about it on the
internet and made it. But after some time, I started to feel like I was not becoming master in some field. I was like jack
of all trades but the master of none. 

So I started reading a lot of articles on How to choose a field in Computer Science. I wanted a field that allowed me to create new interesting things but still had a 
scientific touch to it. So, I finally choose to pursue mastery in Machine Learning field 
because in this field I don't only have to learn different kinds tools, there's maths and science too.

So I am writing this article to help those who are don't know what field to pursue their careers in, or just starting out
in Computer Science in general.

# Core IT Skills
Each career path in IT requires significantly different preparation. However, they all share a common core of knowledge and 
skills.
  
## Technical Skills
One of the most important aspects of being an IT developer is an ability to program machines. Here, the term developer 
implies an ability to build. In the case of IT developers, what you are building is IT systems consisting of hardware 
controlled by software produced through programming. However, programming skills by themselves are not very useful 
unless they are coupled with specific domains such as cyber security or system administration.

## Soft Skills
Technical skills may lead you to job interviews or even job offers. But they are not the only thing that interviewer is
seeing during the interview. He is also focusing on your soft skills that is oral presentation skills, writing skills, 
interpersonal skills, time management skills, leadership skills et cetera.

Due to service nature of IT field, you don't spend all of your time sitting in a cubicle, typing code all day. Even in
smaller companies, a lot of your time will be spent meeting with customers or coworkers, because you are developing 
solutions for them. So you need to interact with them to better understand their problems.

So, Don't ever think you only need technical skills to succeed in IT career. you definitely need social skills as well.
