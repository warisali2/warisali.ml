There's a lot I want to learn, and a lot I've learned that I will be documenting. Here's where I list both.

## To Learn:

My current focus is **Data Science** fundamentals and all things **Machine Learning**.

### Machine Learning

- [ ] Predicting California Housing Prices - Report
- [ ] Predicting Ames Housing Prices - Report

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- [ ] Getting Feel of Data using Spreadsheets

## Learned:

This is not everything I know, but a good amount of the things I've documented since I started this site.
