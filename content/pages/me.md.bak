I’m Waris Ali, a Machine Learning Engineer. 

I started this website as a place to document everything I learn. I [learn in public](/learn) and write about everything I know. 

I aim to create a beautiful corner of the web free of ads, sponsored posts, newsletter pop-ups, affiliate links, and the rest of the annoying noise we're so accustomed to seeing on the internet these days.
